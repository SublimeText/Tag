This is a command for Sublime Text 2 that is meant to be bound to the slash
("/") key in order to semi auto close open HTML tags (in part inspired by the
discussion at http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1358).
Requires build 2111 or later of Sublime Text 2.


INSTALLATION
============
1. Put the file close_tag_on_slash.py into the User folder in your Sublime
   Text 2 Packages folder
   (~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User on Mac OS X)

2. Select Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Key Bindings - User from the main menu

3. Add the following to the keymap file (inside the square brackets) and then
   save it:
   { "keys": ["/"], "command": "close_tag_on_slash" }

4. Done! :)
